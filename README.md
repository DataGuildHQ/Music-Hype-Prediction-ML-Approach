# 📊 MLX 2.0 Regression Challenge

## 📝 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of a machine learning coursework and conducted via a Kaggle-hosted regression competition. The objective was to develop and compare regression models to predict a target variable based on a provided dataset.

Participants were required to:
- Make at least two submissions on Kaggle
- Try at least two different modeling approaches
- Evaluate models using multiple performance metrics
- Submit a final report and supporting code
- Document all approaches in a detailed research paper

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The task is a supervised regression problem where the goal is to predict a song’s popularity score (0-100) using real-world music data, including audio features and artist statistics. The dataset was provided through the Kaggle competition platform.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Language:** Python  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries Used:**  
  - pandas  
  - numpy  
  - scikit-learn   
  - matplotlib / seaborn for data visualization  

---

## 🚀 Approaches

Multiple regression models were implemented and compared, including:

- **Linear Regression** – Simple baseline model  
- **Tree-based Models** – e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest  
- **Other Techniques** – Optional: Ridge/Lasso Regression, Ensemble Models, etc.

Each model was evaluated based on performance and error metrics. Hyperparameter tuning and feature engineering techniques were also explored.

## 📏 Evaluation Metrics

In addition to the competition's primary metric, the following were calculated for a deeper analysis:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**  
- **R² Score**

Metrics were compared across all approaches and discussed in the final report.

## 📄 Deliverables

- Jupyter Notebook files for each approach explored during the project  
- Individual reports submitted by each member  
- A final research paper that documents and explains **all approaches** taken in the project
